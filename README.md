## LP Safe Guard
Designed to be used as a means to trustlessly get a group of depositors to pledge adding liquidity to an LP pool.
The contract facilitates the process of depositing tokens into a liquidity pool. 

## Summary of contract functionality:


- **Purpose**: The contract is designed to facilitate the process of depositing tokens into a liquidity pool.

- **Token Deposit**: Users can deposit two types of tokens (tokenA and tokenB) into the contract. Each deposit needs to meet a certain ratio of tokenA to tokenB, which is set at the deployment of the contract.

- **Deadline and Threshold**: After a certain deadline has passed and if a certain threshold of tokenA deposits has been met, the contract deposits the total amounts of tokenA and tokenB that have been deposited by all users into a liquidity pool.

- **LP Token Calculation**: The contract then calculates the amount of Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens each depositor is entitled to based on their percentage of the total amount of tokens deposited.

- **LP Token Claim**: Users can claim their LP tokens from the contract, which then transfers the LP tokens to the user.


## Function Documentation**:

1. **Constructor**: This function is called when the contract is deployed. It initializes the contract with the addresses of tokenA, tokenB, and the LP token, the amounts for the tokenA to tokenB ratio, the total tokenA threshold, and the address of the liquidity pool.

2. **Deposit**: This function allows a user to deposit tokenA and tokenB into the contract. The deposited amounts are added to the user's current deposited amounts in the `depositors` mapping. If the user deposits tokens in the correct ratio, the deposited amounts are also added to the total deposited amounts. If the total deposit of tokenA reaches the threshold, the deadline for reclaiming tokens is set to 14 days from the current time.

3. **Reclaim**: This function allows a user to reclaim their deposited tokens from the contract. It checks if the current time is before the deadline, then transfers the user's deposited amounts of tokenA and tokenB back to the user, and resets the user's deposited amounts in the `depositors` mapping.

4. **DepositToLiquidityPool**: This function deposits the total amounts of tokenA and tokenB that have been deposited by all users (who have met the required ratio amounts) into a liquidity pool. It calculates the total amounts of tokenA and tokenB to be deposited to the liquidity pool for each depositor by summing up all the amounts they have deposited. Therefore, even if a user has made multiple deposits, there will be only a single LP deposit for the total amount of tokens they have deposited.

5. **ClaimLP**: This function allows a depositor to claim their LP tokens. It first checks if the depositor has any LP tokens to claim, then resets the depositor's LP tokens to zero, and finally transfers the LP tokens to the depositor.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation and the actual implementation will depend on the specific liquidity pool you are using. Also, these functions do not handle any tokens deposited that did not meet the required ratio. You might need to add additional logic to handle these tokens. As always, please make sure to have this contract reviewed by a Solidity expert before deploying it to the mainnet. Smart contracts are immutable once deployed, and any bugs or vulnerabilities could result in loss of funds. It's also crucial to thoroughly test any smart contract before deploying it on the mainnet.
